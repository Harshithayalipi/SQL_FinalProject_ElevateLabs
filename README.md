Results Achieved : 

92% data quality success rate for customer records (23/25)
96% data quality success rate for product records (24/25)
Complete pipeline with 12 tables, 13 indexes, 6 triggers
Monthly sales analytics covering 7 months ($949.99 to $11,096.93 revenue)
Customer segmentation with VIP, regular, and new categories
